== LolitaOrderable

Plugin for simple ordering through one order field


=== Example

1. Add order field, like "order_nr" as integer
2. In model add line "acts_as_orderable" and if needed add :column => "order_field_name" and if you use "lolita_localize" then add this line after "localize".
3. In your controller config method add field
  {:type=>:select,:field=>YOUR_ORDER_FIELD_NAME,:options=>YOUR_MODEL.options_for_orderable,:simple=>true}
4. If your model already has some values then use the 'order_unordered' after adding new column:
  add_column :category, :order_nr, :integer
  Category.order_unordered

Also you can use the move_to function, for example
   item = Item.find 1
   item.move_to 3
Item has moved to 3rd position
